            <p>My name is Carla and I am originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Once upon a time, I visited a small town called Hagi in Yamaguchi, Japan. I still remember the day I saw Hagi-yaki (Hagi pottery) for the first time, I instantly fell in love. You could say that day my heart turned into clay.

                I have studied pottery in Barcelona with a Japanese sensei for a short time, but my main school has been museums (observation) and MVPS (courses).

            <p>I am a very slow student who learned to become happy with failing. After all, some of my most loved pieces were pure mistakes.

            My inspirations are: pre-Colombian pottery and the Mingei movement (Yanagi Soetsu).

            Currently, besides spending time at MVPS I run a little shop that keeps me super busy. </br>
