## What is clay?


Since the earliest times, humankind has had a close association with clay. From use as a building material, in pottery, for treating human digestive ailments to a multitude of industrial uses, clay is a key ingredient in the material world we live in.

Commercially, the most important clays are known as kaolin and bentonite

## Where does clay come from? 

Clay is a soft, loose, earthy material containing particles with a grain size of less than 4 micrometres (μm). It forms as a result of the weathering and erosion of rocks containing the mineral group feldspar (known as the ‘mother of clay’) over vast spans of time.

During weathering, the feldspar content is altered by hydrolysis (reaction with water) to form clay minerals such as kaolinites (the principal minerals in kaolin clays) and smectites (the principal minerals in bentonite clays).

## Clay minerals

Clay minerals have a sheet-like structure and are composed of mainly tetrahedrally arranged silicate and octahedrally arranged aluminate groups.

Kaolinite is the principal mineral in kaolin clays. It is a 1:1 clay mineral – the basic unit is composed of a 2-dimensional (2D) layer of silicate groups tightly bonded to a 2D layer of aluminate groups.

Throughout the mineral, there is a tetrahedraloctahedral (TO) layered structure with tight packing between the layers. This tight packing – like the pages of a closed book – results in kaolinite not shrinking when dry or swelling when wet.

## What is wedging clay?

Wedging clay is a process to make sure the clay is in a proper working condition before you start making pottery with it. The clay is moved in a repetitive way to help remove air bubbles and even out the consistency. There are multiple methods that can be used.

Some potters feel that the clay benefits from the movement of wedging, especially if it will be thrown on the wheel or rolled into slabs. It is said that the particles of the clay become better aligned. This can make centering easier or walls can be thrown taller on the pottery wheel. Slabs may also warp less.

You want to know how to properly wedge clay because of the following:

It’ll create a much better surface for the clay to work on
It’ll make centering easier
You can move air bubbles out
You can create better mounds that work better.
With wedging, it’s a good rule of thumb that if you’re going to make something vertical, you want to have a mound of vertical clay. If you’re going to have something lower to the ground, you’ll want to create an open form, which in turn will make it wider as well.

## Centering

This one is the one that will take a lot of practice.

It makes sense to be slow or feel like there is a lot to learn and understand. 

If you ever feel overwhelmed during class, there is always the option to take a break, or hand build, or just ask for more help.

I recommend you watch this video many times. There are several inspiring videos on centering online. The issue is that people have their own style. Before you investigate a new style, I suggest you stick to one video of your liking for a while.

## How to clean your wheel

Don't forget to clean the little holes on wheel head, and of course your tools.

Pipes get clogged with clay, to avoid damaging them we use three buckets: rinse one | rinse two | clay scrapts.
