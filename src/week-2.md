# Before coming to class
- If you are inspired, it is a good idea to watch the centering video prior the class. If time permits it, take a look at any books you might find at your local libary. Books are a great source of inspiration, not just a reference for finding or studying techniques. 
- I highly recommend you watch the cleaning video, it will help you reshearse how to clean quickly and stress-free before class end.

## Handbuilding

Handbuildng is a lot of fun, faster and more stress free in comparison to the wheel. It is a great idea to use both techniues - they allow you to learn different things about clay. 

### Slab Roller | How to use it

- To protect the longevity of the slab roller we must use two hands to simultaneously adjust the thickness of the slab. 
- Make sure use a canvas that matches your clay body color. For house clay: dark.
- We compressed our clay with a soft sponge or rib tool.

### Handbuilding videos - MUG | CUP

Two different techniques, both great.

While having a super sharp knife seems like a great idea, this is not essential - you can use your potter’s needle to cut and scratch like a cat. The needle is super handy in both videos. Umi-san has fancy tools, you don’t need to be fancy. Your finger and a sponge can achieve a lot on their own.  Enjoy the videos and see what technique resonates more with you - perhaps try both?

- Tip: whenever you want to add a part to the cup or any piece, use the potters needle to scratch and then the “glue” slip we have in the studio. Make sure you use the right slip called Reclaimed Clay.

- Do you think you will make a little cup with a slab? with or without a handle? what about a foot? or a face?
- Bonus: Do you think you can make another shape other than a cup?
