   # Understanding trimming

  <a href="https://archive.org/details/japanesepotteryh0000simp" class="hover:bg-orange-300 hover:underline cursor-pointer" target="_blank">
  Passage from a "Ceramic's a potter's handbook by Nelson, Glenn C</a>

  >Trimming removes excess clay from the bottom of a pot, so that it is lighter and less likely to crack. If desired, trimming can give the pot a foot - a ridge of clay at the base to serve as a design accent. Some pots can be trimmed during the throwing stage and the mark of the cutting wire left as it is. Most often, trimming is done when the pots have dried to the leather-hard stage – still most but dry enough to hold their shape without distorting. If the pot becomes too dry, there is a danger of cracking; if too soft, it will sag. 

  >A pot that becomes too dry after throwing can be restored to a leather-hard state by spraying it with a plant mister both inside and out. This should be done several times to ensure an even absorption of water. 

  >When a pot is leather hard, observe its inside shape and judge its thickness to determine how much clay needs to be removed. If you are unsure, insert a pin.

- Tip: make sure you take small amounts of clay in each go, it is like shaving, not digging.
- You want a leather hard piece, but if a piece is too dry I tend to use a sponge with water (small amount) to help with the piece and make it easier for me to trim - while if a piece is leather hard perfect, one does not need to use water but just sharp clean tools. 
Easy to rememnber:
- High pitch →  thin or less amount of clay.
- Low pitch →  thicker, you can take more clay.
