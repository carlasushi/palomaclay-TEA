  Tip: Cornstarch helps releasing a stamp from a slab of clay. You roll the slab, compress it, dust it with cornstarch, and then impress it with a stamp. The cornstarch will burn during the first firing.

  ## Museo Larco
  ### Erotic Gallery
The eroticism present in this major pottery collection evokes desire, attraction and the coming together of the opposing yet complementary forces that enable life to endlessly regenerate.

At the heart of the Andean worldview is the concept of tinkuy: the generative meeting of opposite and complementary forces. Just as the day gives way to night before dawn comes once more, and the dry season gives way to the rains so that crops can flourish, men and women come together to engender new life.
One of the clearest expressions of tinkuy in the art of ancient Peru is the scene depicting the mythological union of the civilizing Moche hero with Mother Earth (Pachamama). From this sexual encounter the tree of life is born as a symbol of continual renewal, the continuity of existence, and the good life (kawkay) of the community. The tree of life is a universal symbol, present in different mythologies throughout history, and a potent reminder of the renewal that comes from the erotic impulse and the sexual act.
