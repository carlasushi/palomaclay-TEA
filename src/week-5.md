“As an art, pottery has occupied a unique position somewhere in between sculpture and painting; that is, pottery forms which are highly dimensional and voluminous in character have been clothed in colors, textures, and motifs which relate to painting and drawing”

# Last week main goals:

- Finish glazing any pieces you might have in the brisk fired shelves.
- Correct any pieces you might have on the correction shelve.
- Go over glazing techniques.
- If you are not continuing with the SAME class, please empty your shelve. If you are continuing to take classes at the studio, but you are enrolled in a different class, please re-locate your items to the correspondent shelve area.
- Keep practicing and have fun.

## MVPS glaze guide 


>  MVPS does allow students and members to use glazes purchased from a commercial retailer, however, but we require pre-approval of ALL outside glazes & underglazes to avoid kiln accidents. Our kilns fire at cone 5 and we allow many commercial cone 5 glazes, however, we reserve the right not to approve any glaze not suitable for our studio. See a staff member for a glaze approval sticker. 

Do Not Buy or Use The Following:
- Underglazes by Mayco or Duncan
- Any underglaze that fluxes at 05/06
- Crawl glazes
- Lava glazes

Anything that is very runny and will stick pots to the kiln shelf
