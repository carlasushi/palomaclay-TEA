“As an art, pottery has occupied a unique position somewhere in between sculpture and painting; that is, pottery forms which are highly dimensional and voluminous in character have been clothed in colors, textures, and motifs which relate to painting and drawing”

# Theory: glazes, what are they?
## Learning about glazes

As previously mentioned, the chemical composition of clay is similar to the average composition of the surface of the earth. This is a simple yet amazing concept to ponder upon. 

Similarly, when studying glazes, you will be amazed by their intrinsic magic. Unlike clay and clay bodies, the study of glaze is much more complex: materials involved, application techniques, formulations, etc. 

You do not need to get too involved in the details of the glazes. You can just learn about application techniques and express yourself creatively. 

## Glazes as glass

Glazes on pottery are similar to other kinds of glass. To understand pottery glazes when thinking about glass, consider the phenomenon of melting and the tendency of matter to crystallize. 
All the materials of which the earth is formed were at the beginning, in a vaporous or liquid state.  This was due to the elevated temperatures of the early stages of the formation of the earth. 
As the temperature dropped, the earth surface solidified or froze. 

Hot → liquid state.

Cold → solid state. 


When a substance cools down in temperature, it tends to take a crystalline state. Similarly to diamonds, and other precious stones, the molecules of crystalline substances are arranged in recurring sequences or patterns which repeat themselves three-dimensionally. 


The more silica a glaze contains, the more glass like it will be. As for glass objects, they are, at times, made from silica alone. 

Silica is the basis of all practical glasses, and to facilitate its melting and fabrication, fluxes are added to it. The fluxes lower the melting point, allowing the forming of the glass at lower temperatures. 

Take a look at this photo, this is how silica naturally occurs.

For the advanced student, learning chemistry and thinking about atoms, molecules and chemical reactions could be something to consider or pursue in the long term.

# Practice: A slow and gentle start

## Combination glazes versus single glaze
When beginning to learn about glazes, simply observing application combinations will be sufficient. 
In our glaze room, we have a comprehensive and vast library of colors. There are combinations and single glaze applications:
- Combination two coats: “ X glaze under” (first coat), wait 15 minutes “Y glaze over” (second coat).
- Single glaze one or two coats : “X glaze under”, wait 15 minutes “X glaze over” (second coat). Note that at times, one single coat is sufficient. 
- Three coats are not recommended. 


Perhaps stick to a small selection of glazes and practice one glazing technique several times. 
Maybe start with single glaze applications (one color only, one coat, two coats, compare and contrast).
Keep a concise journal. Take a memo of those colors you like the most. Develop your own glaze palette.

The most “forgiving” glazes might be, in no particular order: 
- White Satin, 
- Moonlight, 
- Licorice, 
- Raw Sienna, 
- Rutile, and 
- Clear. 
  
 While those which run more, such as Floating Blue, might be more tricky to understand and predict.

# MVPS glaze guide 


>  MVPS does allow students and members to use glazes purchased from a commercial retailer, however, but we require pre-approval of ALL outside glazes & underglazes to avoid kiln accidents. Our kilns fire at cone 5 and we allow many commercial cone 5 glazes, however, we reserve the right not to approve any glaze not suitable for our studio. See a staff member for a glaze approval sticker. 

Do Not Buy or Use The Following:
- Underglazes by Mayco or Duncan
- Any underglaze that fluxes at 05/06
- Crawl glazes
- Lava glazes

Anything that is very runny and will stick pots to the kiln shelf
