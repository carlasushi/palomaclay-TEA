Introduction to decorating & glazing pottery
by Fairbairn, Caroliney</a>
</h2>

This is a reader's entree to a rewarding pastime and a thousands-year-old tradition. The carefully chosen selection of pottery projects is divided into three main sections, each concentrating on a particular decorating method, including underglaze, glaze, and onglaze. Clear step-by-step instructions lead readers through each photographically illustrated project.
