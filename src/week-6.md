## Last week main goals:

- Finish glazing any pieces you might have in the brisk fired shelves.
- Correct any pieces you might have on the correction shelve.
- Go over glazing techniques.
- If you are not continuing with the SAME class, please empty your shelve. If you are continuing to take classes at the studio, but you are enrolled in a different class, please re-locate your items to the correspondent shelve area.
- Practice, breath, fail, smile and start again.
